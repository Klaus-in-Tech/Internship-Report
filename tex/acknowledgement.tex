\chapter*{Acknowledgement}


\noindent I am very appreciated to Mr. Sewanonda Dagan, my supervisor at Banana Phone World. Dagan gave me very in-time valuable instructions and put me in contact with experts in the field like Mr.
Alex Onyango, Value Added Services Manager at MTN, who gave me extensive guidance regarding many practical issues. I also would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Emmanuel Lule  for his permission to be my academic supervisor. \medskip

\noindent Throughout the internship, I have also learnt many things about the Chinese culture whose
benefits are far beyond what I could learn in a normal project. In short, I would like to thank
Banana Phone World and Makerere University, Internship Office especially Ms. Barbra Nansamba  for introducing me to this great opportunity in which I have developed myself both academically, professionally and socially.
